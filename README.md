# Application Overview

## About the Application

This application is designed to connect and manage smart devices, sensors, and activities, providing users with the ability to set reminders, track daily activities, and manage permissions based on roles. It integrates devices like smartwatches and actuators to enable automatic responses to environmental and user-defined triggers.

## Key Components

### Users and Roles
- **Users**: Each user has a unique identifier and is assigned a role that defines their access permissions within the application.
- **Roles**: Roles determine the access levels and capabilities for each user.
- **Permissions**: Permissions specify what actions each role can perform in the system.

### Devices
- **Devices**: All connected devices within the application, including sensors and actuators.
- **Sensors**: Monitor environmental or system conditions, detecting specific trigger conditions to respond to.
- **Actuators**: Devices that perform actions in response to sensor triggers or user commands.

### Smartwatch Integration
- **Smartwatch**: Tracks the userâ€™s activities and health metrics, such as step count and pulse rate.

### Activities and Reminders
- **Activities**: Represents daily activities, including start and end times.
- **Reminders**: Allows users to set reminders for specific activities, with options to customize time and message.

### Actions and Interactions
- **Actions**: Specific operations that an actuator can perform, identified by an action ID.
- **Activations**: When a sensor detects a defined condition, it activates an actuator to perform a related action.

## Example Usage

A typical use case involves a user tracking their daily activities through their smartwatch, setting reminders, or automating actions for their connected devices. For example:
- If a sensor detects an environmental change, it can activate an actuator to adjust settings (like temperature control).
- Users can monitor their activities and receive reminders to stay on schedule.
